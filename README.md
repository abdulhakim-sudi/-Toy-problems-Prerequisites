# JavaScript Toy Problems

This repository contains solutions to a set of JavaScript toy problems designed to practice fundamental programming concepts. Each problem has been implemented as a separate JavaScript function, and the solutions are organized in this repository.

## Challenges

### 1. Student Grade Generator
A function that prompts the user to input student marks and outputs a grade based on the following criteria:
- A: 80 and above
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 50 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: below 40

### 2. Speed Detector
A program that takes a car's speed as input. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), the program will assign one demerit point. If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program will print: “License suspended”.

### 3. New Challenge (Example)
